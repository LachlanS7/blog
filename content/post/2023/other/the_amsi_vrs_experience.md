# The AMSI VRS Experience

Over the 2022-2023 summer break, I participated in the *Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute Vacation Research Scholarship* (AMSI VRS). This was a paid six week research project where I studied a project of my choice with supervisors. The research concluded with a research paper and a research conference where we spoke about our research.

## The Project

I chose to study the *Category of Dessin d'Enfants* with [Prof. Finnur LÃ¡russon](http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/finnur.larusson/) and [Dr. Daniel Stevenson](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/daniel.stevenson). These are undirected, connected graphs with two special properties:
1. Bipartite: this is where the nodes of the graph are split into two sets: black and white. An edge between two nodes must always connect a black node to a white -- never a black to a black or a white to a white
2. Ordering on edges: There was a cyclic ordering on edges for each node.

With this, we can look at the set (the category) of all dessin d'enfants. We can investigate what it means to map between to graphs, and how these maps behave. We can investigate how these objects and maps look like objects and maps from other categories. This was the crux of my research. To investigate if the category of dessin d'enfants behaved similarly to the category of sets. In the case it does, we call the category a *topos* -- named after the *Grothendieck topos*.

To acheive this, it was required to show that the category of dessin d'enfants contained objects that exhibited particular properties. One such object is known as a *terminal object*. This is an object that all other objects can map to. The analogue of this in the category of sets is the empty set $\emptyset$. In the category of dessin d'enfants, this was the object with two nodes and a single edge.

All in all, it was shown that while the category of dessin d'enfants was not a topos, the category of generalised dessin d'enfants (dessin d'enfants which ought not be connected) is infact a topos. The consequence of this finding is that many operations we do over sets can be redefined over generalised dessin d'enfants -- allowing us to do logic with dessin d'enfants.
